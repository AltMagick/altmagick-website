## What legal basis does AltMagick rely on to process the Customer's information?

_In Short:_ AltMagick only processes the Customer's personal information when AltMagick believes it is necessary and AltMagick has a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with the Customer's consent, to comply with laws, to provide the Customer with services to enter into or fulfill AltMagick's contractual obligations, to protect the Customer's rights, or to fulfill AltMagick's legitimate business interests.

### For EU and UK residents

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require AltMagick to explain the valid legal bases AltMagick relies on in order to process the Customer's personal information. As such, AltMagick may rely on the following legal bases to process the Customer's personal information:

* Consent. AltMagick may process the Customer's information if the Customer have given AltMagick permission (i.e., consent) to use the Customer's personal information for a specific purpose. The Customer can withdraw their consent at any time.
* Legal Obligations. AltMagick may process the Customer's information where AltMagick believes it is necessary for compliance with AltMagick's legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend AltMagick's legal rights, or disclose the Customer's information as evidence in litigation in which AltMagick is involved.
* Vital Interests. AltMagick may process the Customer's information where AltMagick believes it is necessary to protect the Customer's vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
### For Canadian residents

AltMagick may process the Customer's information if the Customer have given AltMagick specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use the Customer's personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where the Customer's permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). The Customer can withdraw their consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, AltMagick may be legally permitted under applicable law to process the Customer's information without their consent, including, for example:

* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
* If AltMagick has reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be a victim of financial abuse
* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
* If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

## When and with whom does AltMagick share the Customer's personal information?

_In Short:_ AltMagick may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.

AltMagick may need to share the Customer's personal information in the following situations:

* **Business Transfers.** AltMagick may share or transfer the Customer's information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of AltMagick business to another company.

## Does AltMagick use cookies and other tracking technologies?

_In Short:_ Both AltMagick website and AltMagick browser extensions do not use cookies or other tracking technologies.

AltMagick is committed to the Customer's privacy, so whether it is on AltMagick website or to provide the Customer with the Service, AltMagick does not use cookies or other tracking technologies.

## How long does AltMagick keep the Customer's information?

_In Short:_ AltMagick keeps the Customer's information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

AltMagick will only keep the Customer's personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).  
No purpose in this notice will require AltMagick to keep the Customer's personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with AltMagick.

When AltMagick has no ongoing legitimate business need to process the Customer's personal information, AltMagick will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because the Customer's personal information has been stored in backup archives), then AltMagick will securely store the Customer's personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## How does AltMagick keep the Customer's information safe?

_In Short:_ AltMagick aims to protect the Customer's personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

AltMagick has implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information AltMagick processes.  
However, despite AltMagick's safeguards and efforts to secure the Customer's information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so AltMagick cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat AltMagick's security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify the Customer's information.  
Although AltMagick will do its best to protect the Customer's personal information, transmission of personal information to and from AltMagick Services is at the Customer's own risk.  
The Customer should only access the Services within a secure environment.

### What are the Customer's privacy rights?

The Customer can withdraw their consent at any time by contacting AltMagick by using the contact details provided in the section "How can the Customer contact AltMagick about this notice?" below.

## Will the Customer's information be shared with anyone else?

AltMagick may disclose the Customer's personal information with AltMagick service providers pursuant to a written contract between AltMagick and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on AltMagick behalf.

AltMagick may use the Customer's personal information for AltMagick's own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of the Customer's personal information.

Gaëtan LE HEURT-FINOT (EI) has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months.  
Gaëtan LE HEURT-FINOT (EI) will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other consumers.

## The Customer's rights with respect to the Customer's personal data

### Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete

The Customer can ask for the deletion of the Customer's personal information.  
If the Customer asks AltMagick to delete the Customer's personal information, AltMagick will respect the Customer's request and delete the Customer's personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, AltMagick compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

### Right to be informed — Request to know

Depending on the circumstances, the Customer has a right to know:

* whether AltMagick collects and uses the Customer's personal information;
* the categories of personal information that AltMagick collects;
* the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
* whether AltMagick sells the Customer's personal information to third parties;
* the categories of personal information that AltMagick sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
* the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and

In accordance with applicable law, AltMagick is not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

### Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights

AltMagick will not discriminate against the Customer if the Customer exercises the Customer's privacy rights.

### Verification process

Upon receiving the Customer's request, AltMagick will need to verify the Customer's identity to determine the Customer is the same person about whom AltMagick has the information in our system.  
These verification efforts require AltMagick to ask the Customer to provide information so that AltMagick can match it with information the Customer has previously provided AltMagick.  
For instance, depending on the type of request the Customer submits, AltMagick may ask the Customer to provide certain information so that AltMagick can match the information the Customer provides with the information AltMagick already has on file, or AltMagick may contact the Customer through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that the Customer has previously provided to AltMagick. AltMagick may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

AltMagick will only use personal information provided in the Customer's request to verify the Customer's identity or authority to make the request.  
To the extent possible, AltMagick will avoid requesting additional information from the Customer for the purposes of verification.  
However, if AltMagick cannot verify the Customer's identity from the information already maintained by AltMagick, AltMagick may request that the Customer provide additional information for the purposes of verifying the Customer's identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. AltMagick will delete such additionally provided information as soon as AltMagick finishes verifying the Customer.

### Other privacy rights

* The Customer may object to the processing of the Customer's personal information.
* The Customer may request correction of the Customer's personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
* The Customer can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on the Customer's behalf. AltMagick may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on the Customer's behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
* The Customer may request to opt out from future selling of the Customer's personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, AltMagick will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.

To exercise these rights, the Customer can [contact AltMagick](mailto:gaetan@altmagick.com).  
If the Customer has a complaint about how AltMagick handles the Customer's data, AltMagick would like to hear from the Customer.
